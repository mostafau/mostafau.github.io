I am comfortable in teaching any undergraduate and graduate level computer science and engineering courses.

Atboth the undergraduate and graduate levels, I am interested in designing new courses that address recent advancements inEmbedded Sensing Systems, Mobile Computing, Ubiquitous Computing, and Cyber-Physical Systems.
